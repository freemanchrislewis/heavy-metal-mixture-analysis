# Heavy Metal Analysis
A statistical analysis of heavy metal mixtures and their association with health outcomes, focusing on logistic regression, WQS regression, and BKMR.


This repository contains Python code for analyzing heavy metal mixtures and their association with health outcomes.

## Analysis Techniques
- Logistic regression for binary disease outcomes
- Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression for mixture effects
- Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) for nonlinear associations and interactions

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific models.

## Authors
- Freeman Lewis (Flewi017@fiu.edu)
